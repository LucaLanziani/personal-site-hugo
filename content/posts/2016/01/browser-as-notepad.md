From time to time, I need to note something down, from a snippet of code to some lorem ipsum.

Of course, I can open a text editor and paste the text there but **is it worth keeping another window around** when I already have a browser open on one of my screens?

<!--more-->

**Why not use the browser as a notepad?**

Just copy this code into your URL bar and press <enter>:

```
data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
```

And paste the content or start writing something in the body ;).
