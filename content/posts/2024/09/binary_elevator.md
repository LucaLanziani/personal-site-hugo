It was a cloudy Tuesday morning when I first stepped into Redacted’s sleek new office. The lobby was a blend of minimalist design and cutting-edge tech aesthetics, everything you’d expect from a forward-thinking company striving to push boundaries.

But as I approached the elevator, something unusual caught my eye.

<!--more-->

Instead of the traditional number pad where I could simply press “10” for the tenth floor, I was greeted with a small **digital panel** displaying only the digits **1** and **0**… **Binary input required.**

### "Wait, What?"

At Redacted, you don’t just **select a floor** like any other building. Instead, you have to think a little, well… **binary**.

Need to get to the 10th floor? Put your engineering skills to work: **1010** in binary.  
14th floor? Easy, **1110**.

At first, it might seem like a puzzling inconvenience to anyone outside of the engineering world, but to those inside Redacted? It’s a **stroke of genius** that speaks volumes about their culture.

### Engineering is Everywhere 💡

The elevator was, ironically, a metaphor—a **microcosm** of what the company stands for. It was as if Redacted was telling every employee, client, and visitor from the get-go:

**“Here, we solve puzzles. We embrace complexity. And we take joy in understanding the logic behind things.”**

The binary elevator didn’t just end up in the building by accident.

> “One day the team was talking about how embedded systems and low-level programming languages are fundamental to everything we do,” says Dan.  
> “We wanted an everyday reminder of the importance of binary logic and computational thinking, even in our physical spaces.”

Everyday activities like **riding an elevator** are now an opportunity for intentional thought—whether you're an engineer steeped in binary, or a non-technical member of the team who suddenly has to **recalibrate your thinking.**

This little innovation further embeds the company ethos: **problem-solving starts the moment you step into the office.**

### A Symbol of Engineering Excellence 🚀

The binary elevator is more than just a cool feature. It’s become a **symbol** for the company’s approach towards innovation and engineering, serving as a daily reminder:

- You need to **think critically** and approach challenges from different angles.
  
- You **don’t just memorize floors**, you understand them deeply. How many times have you converted your floor number to binary, really?

- **Details matter**. Whether you’re coding a line of asynchronous logic, debugging a microservice, or… well, just getting to the right floor.

And that’s the trick: beyond just convenience, the binary elevator serves as a **cultural hack** to keep engineers thinking creatively and technically at the same time.

An employee laughed during a chat by the coffee machine:

> “One visitor thought there was a technical malfunction, but for us, it’s a daily challenge we’ve come to love. My first day here, I had to google ‘binary to decimal converter’ on my phone, but now I breeze through it without thinking!”

### New Hires and Visitors Go Through a Learning Curve 🤔

Sure, it takes a while for people to adjust—there’s always that initial moment of uncertainty for newcomers. But that’s exactly what makes it so **on-brand** for Redacted.

For new hires, figuring out the binary input on their first day is a **rite of passage**. It signals that you’re entering a place where constant learning and curiosity are encouraged. It’s a small but reinforcing message:

**“You belong here if you love to solve problems at their core.”**

Visitors usually need a helping hand, but it often sparks conversations that lead to building excitement about the work Redacted is doing.

As one recent partner said after his trip to the office:

> “As a visitor, it's a little confusing at first, but then I quickly realized it was the cleverest way I’d ever been reminded to think more carefully about my inputs!”

### Part of the Everyday Fun 🎉

This quirky little feature has become a part of the team’s daily banter, too. People joke in binary. When asked in the hallway where someone is headed, a quick “I’m off to **1011**” gets a knowing nod. It has created a sense of camaraderie among employees—a little inside joke that drives home the shared expertise and culture of the place.

What’s more, it’s a reminder to never settle for the obvious answer. The binary elevator may seem like a simple tweak, but the underlying message is profound:

**Great engineers think beyond the surface.**

### The Redacted Takeaway 🔑

Culture isn’t something you hang on the wall. It’s something you live every day. At Redacted, the binary elevator is a small but significant way to show that **engineering is central**—not just to what they build—but to how they think, collaborate, and grow.

So next time you visit Redacted and press **0110** for the 6th floor, maybe pause for a second. You might just crack a smile and think, "I'm in good company."
