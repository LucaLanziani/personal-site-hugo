## Back to the Office
We continue to cite DHH and largely agree with his summary that Hybrid Working could be a bit rubbish, we skip quickly through the articles that he cites and share some of our feelings as we do.

[DHH: Hybrid Working is the worst choice](https://world.hey.com/dhh/hybrid-combines-the-worst-of-office-and-remote-work-d3174e50)   
[Meta returns to the office](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/01/business/meta-return-to-office/index.html)  
[The Year of Efficiency](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/)    
[Farmers Insurance forced to return to the office](https://nypost.com/2023/06/06/farmers-insurance-workers-blast-return-to-office-mandate/) 
[Salesforce do charity!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/08/google-salesforce-return-to-office/)    
[Amazon unfazed by rebellious workers](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-unfazed-remote-workers-protesting-190427347.html)  

## Ways of Working
Agile, agile and more agile. McKinsey talk interview Sir Jony Ive. We finish with Dan ranting about Dell's data science ways of working.

[McKinsey Interview Sir Jony Ive](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-creative-process-is-fabulously-unpredictable-a-great-idea-cannot-be-predicted)    
[Dell's data science team discover agile](https://thenewstack.io/how-dells-data-science-team-benefits-from-agile-practices/)    

## Data and ML

Love it or hate it, Data Mesh remains a thing and something that Dan still thinks of as a sensible approach to adopt. We then move to AI or is that LLMs, they're the same thing, right?

Is AI consuming AI output going to result in a computer prion disease? Are small high quality data sets really a viable alternative to reading the entire internet into a training set?

We finish with a Dan gushing over one blogpost by Marc Andreseen and a TED video of Sal Khan talking about how AI could save (not destroy) education.

Join us, in the biggest edit yet, as Luca attempts to limit the damage Dan can cause with unprofessional comments and tangents.
