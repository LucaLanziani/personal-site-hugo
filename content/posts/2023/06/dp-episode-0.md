## The Cost of Observability!
An eagle-eyed analyst spotted a $65 billion line item in the Datadog annual report, who could this be? [Twitter went wild](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1654577231937544192/photo/1) and it turns out that [Coinbase](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/datadog-65m-year-customer-mystery/) did indeed spend a decent chunk of cash on observability. We talk about what happened, how the story unfolded and how to justify such a number … as well as [who gets the blame](https://thenewstack.io/datadogs-65m-bill-and-why-developers-should-care/) when things go wrong

## Goodbye, Cloud!
We know that [DHH thinks the cloud is expensive](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0). He's also [critical of serverless](https://world.hey.com/dhh/don-t-be-fooled-by-serverless-776cd730) and perhaps rightly so. Well, it turns out that the Amazon Prime Video crew may have similar feelings! Again Twitter exploded, as they [announced reducing costs by 90%](https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90). Serverless, Microservices or Monoliths what do we do next?

## Rival Streaming schools
Kafka is dominant in the event sourcing game. Redpanda are looking to each some of Confluent's lunch, [benchmarking](https://redpanda.com/blog/kafka-kraft-vs-redpanda-performance-2023) well with [robust data guarantees](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexandergallego_why-fsync-losing-unsynced-data-on-a-activity-7064299605567434754-d7-0/) there's been a bit of hubbub - Confluent are in the process of creating a blog series that query some of the Redpanda claims. Alexander Gallego put out a wonderful offer to LinkedIn: "Bring me your confluent bill I will cut by 50% or I will give you money." We discuss why you should care and why Redpanda is very much a viable alternative to Kafka, Confluent or otherwise.

## Rise of the LLMs
[Mosaic announced mpt-7b](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b), open-source commercially usable LLMS, trained for $200 no, wait! $200k all in 9.5 days and zero human intervention. The pace of LLMs is wonderful and terrifying, it's great to see the open-source community provide OpenAI alternatives.

Speaking of which things may get cheaper still, [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) presents yet another memory reducing mechanism to finetune LLMs - utilise the 48BG CPU you have laying around!

Cheaper and better LLMs that can utilised by anyone for a great many purposes decentralises power and means that everyone can benefit from the rise of LLMs. Run on-prem or your own cloud, keep your data to yourself and [reduce risk around leaking data](https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-workers-leaked-company-secrets-by-using-chatgpt).

Not that everything AI means LLMs, but here we go again, this week Gitlab announced that [Gitlab 16](https://about.gitlab.com/sixteen/) would see a launch event on the 22nd of June. Featuring a suite of new functionality including Code Suggestions, reviewers and comment summaries - we discuss why you should care and what this means for developers going forward.

**If the machines don't take over we will see you next time for FinOps with a regular Everything Delivery podcast.**
