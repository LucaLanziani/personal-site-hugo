## AI

[Sccccrrreeeeeech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7iyvOQ4gac), the Falcon has landed. Another week brings another foundation model. The folks at the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://falconllm.tii.ae/index.html) have released [Falcon 180B](https://falconllm.tii.ae/falcon-180b.html).

You can go see the [huggingface blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon-180b) for further details.

Dan's tangent on Rust and Data Engineering. First up we have the article from [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/blog/rust-for-data-engineering). From here I ramble about a number of things, but essentially, Rust is smaller, faster and more sustainable that Python - it's way better at exploiting the hardware you're running on, with lower overhead.

You can read about the things I mention at the following places:

[burn](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn) - a comprehensive deep learning framework, offering exceptional flexibility and written in Rust  
[candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) - a minimalist ML framework for Rust with a focus on performance  
[Notebook Evaluation for Rust](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr) get rust in your jupyter notebooks  
[polars](https://www.pola.rs/) - fast dataframes for rust and python  
[pyo3 - Rust bindings for Python](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
