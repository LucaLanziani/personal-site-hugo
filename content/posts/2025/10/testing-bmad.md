Weekend project: Test the BMAD Method on a real-world problem.

<!--more-->

I've been mulling over an industry challenge for quite some time, and this feels like the ideal chance to design and perhaps even build a solution using BMAD-METHOD.

I'll share my takeaways from the process in a future post.

In the meantime, I'm curious to learn about your experiences with BMAD. Does it deliver the right user experience? Has it improved the overall process for you?

You can learn more about the method [here](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)

## Update few hours later

Small update on my BMAD-METHOD experience.

After iterating on the product brief with the Product Manager for about 45 minutes, I'm now chatting with the Architect.

We've had 3-4 back and forth exchanges, and I now have a 2241 lines ARCHITECTURE.md file to review.

Wish me luck 😅.
