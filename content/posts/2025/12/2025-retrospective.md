As 2025 comes to a close, it's time to reflect on the year that was. From professional milestones to personal growth, this year has been packed with experiences. This is my personal diary to help me remember them in years to come.

## January & February

I started the year with a series of LinkedIn posts about DevOps, all in Italian. The title was "Let's talk about DevOps" and I covered various topics from CI/CD to Infrastructure as Code.


## March

At the start of March I posted the following, I still think it's one of the best summaries of what AI was at the time:

> Vibe coding. We aimed at Engineering we settled for the vibes.

I also promised in March I was going to contribute more to Open Source, but that didn't quite happen as I hoped. I did manage to contribute to a few projects here and there, but nothing major.

April was a busy month, I was at Kubecon distributing Nearform's Open Source - Is Art t-shirts. Met a lot of friends and made some new ones. The event was a blast, and it was great to see the community coming together.

## May & June

Before the summer, I spent a month going deeper into Go, and I must say, it's a language that grows on you. The more I use it, the more I appreciate its simplicity and power. It's very possible that I'll be using it more in 2026 and it might even become my primary language for certain projects.

## August

Summer time was great, some relaxing time with family and friends at the seaside. I also managed to squeeze in some reading and learning, which always helps recharge the batteries.

## September

Back to DevOps after the break, this was the highlight of the year for me. It's clear that as DevOps we still have a lot to do to make the software development lifecycle smoother and more efficient. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in 2026.

## October

October was also the month I wrote the post ["I was highly skeptical, but now I'm a believer."](/posts/2025/10/skeptical-to-believer/) which captured my evolving perspective on AI and LLMs. It was a personal reflection on how my views have changed over time.

That's because of the advancements in AI models, the identification of practical applications, and my growing proficiency and confidence in using these technologies.

But I wasn't done traveling yet. In October, I was in London at Observability Con. I was dressed as a doctor to help diagnose observability issues. It was a fun event and I got to meet some great people in the field.

## November & December

November was all about wrapping up projects and preparing for the end of the year. With a bunch of friends, we launched the [ainativeteams.com](https://ainativeteams.com) website and shared a lot of knowldge and learning both on the website and on LinkedIn.



# Reflections

2025 has been a year of growth and learning. I've had the opportunity to explore new technologies, deepen my understanding of AI, and connect with amazing people in the industry.

For the new year, I'm looking forward to continuing this journey. I will keep going deeper into Spec Driven Development and AI Agents, hopefully making it more convenient for teams to collaborate and innovate.

I will also be focusing on myself, both in terms of health and personal development. After all, a well-rounded life is key to sustained success.

Here's to a fantastic 2026 ahead! Cheers! 🥂
