Hello, I'm Luca, nice to meet you.

{{< resize-image src="profile.jpg" alt="A picture of me" class="about-me" >}}

I'm a Software Engineer based in Italy, a dad and the Head of DevOps and Platform Engineering at [NearForm](https://nearform.com).

- Born as a Software Developer with a real passion for Linux.
- I got interested in infrastructure and processes soon after the start of my professional career.
- Grown into this new mindset between DevOps and SRE.
- Moved to management in 2016. As a manager, I keep pushing the DevOps philosophy whenever I can.

Very passionate about GitOps and Kubernetes.

Being Italian, I love socializing, so feel free to contact me if you want to connect.
