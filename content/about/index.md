{{< resize-image src="profile.jpg" alt="A picture of me" class="about-me" >}}

I'm a Software Engineer, a dad, and the Head of DevOps and Platform Engineering at [NearForm](https://nearform.com).

- Born as a Software Developer with a real passion for Linux.
- I got interested in infrastructure and processes soon after the start of my professional career.
- Grew into this new mindset between DevOps and SRE.
- Moved to management in 2016. As a manager, I keep pushing the DevOps philosophy whenever I can.

Very passionate about GitOps and Kubernetes.

Being Italian, I love socializing.  
Ping me in one of the socials above if you want to connect.
