## Hi, I'm Luca

I'm a Head of DevOps and Platform Engineering who got into this field because, as a developer, I kept running into problems that needed solving. Turns out, I enjoy working on them.

### What I Do

I serve as a Subject Matter Expert in DevOps and Platform Engineering and supervise teams across different clients. I'm involved in presales activities, manage client relationships, and I'm ultimately responsible for the successful delivery of our engagements.

My focus is on improving the full software development lifecycle, from planning and development to deployment, monitoring, and everything in between.

I've been working remotely since 2015, not because it was trendy, but because I believed in it before the world caught up. That's a decade of experience managing distributed teams and organizing work without needing someone looking over my shoulder.

### What I'm Passionate About

**Programming**: Despite the management responsibilities, I still write code as much as I can. It's the only way to keep my skills sharp and stay grounded in the reality of what my teams deal with every day. I picked up GoLang last year because learning new languages keeps me from getting comfortable.

**DevOps & SDLC**: I'm focused on the full software development lifecycle—from planning and requirements through building, releasing, and monitoring. The unsexy stuff that makes or breaks production systems.

**AI & Spec-Driven Development**: I'm particularly excited about how AI is changing the way we work and how specifications can drive better development practices. Check out my [series on Spec-Driven Development](/series/spec-driven-development/) if you want to dive deeper.

### Beyond Code

I'm based in Italy, where I spend my free time playing guitar and singing when I can find the time. Music is my way of unplugging from terminals and dashboards.

### Let's Connect

I'm always interested connecting with others who care about making software delivery better. Whether you want to talk about platform engineering, remote work, or just share war stories from production incidents, reach out.
