Hello, I'm Luca, nice to meet you.

{{< resize-image src="profile.jpg" alt="A picture of me" class="about-me" >}}

I'm a Software Engineer based in Italy juggling between being a dad and a Technical Lead at [NearForm](https://nearform.com).

Passionate about GitOps and Kubernetes, I'm spending most of my time helping my Team build and scale our infrastructure.

Being Italian, I love socializing so feel free to reach out to me if you want to connect.
