How to visualize working with AI Agents 👇

Imagine a room full of inexperienced developers next door. They have access to every documentation page and most of the code ever written.

They can parse your code in a matter of minutes.
They type at the speed of light.
They never get tired.

But they are still inexperienced! 🚨 

If you want to shine with AI, you can't just be a coder anymore.
You have to be a Team Lead.

The dynamic is simple:

0. [optional] Prepare an example (For repetitive tasks, do the first task yourself)
1. Assign them tasks (Write the spec/plan and add the example from step 0).
2. Monitor the process (Make sure instructions are followed).
3. Review the result (QA the output).

Don't replace your judgment with their speed. Combine them.
